<p class="about">
Hello! My name is Trina Armitage and welcome to my portfolio website. I am a sophmore at UIC and am in the College of Art Architecture and Design and am majoring in graphic design. I have always wanted to study in something associated with art. In middle school and high school I was in band and marching band and have also been in the bands at UIC. The instrument I play is flute and I knew I wanted to play it because of the sound it makes! When I was younger I also used to draw pictures and paint. I was in art club in middle school and in high school I unfortunately was not able to take an art class because of band. Even though I was not able to take classes I still wanted to pursure my dream of becoming a graphic designer. The initial classes I have been taking at UIC have been a wonderful experience and I am excited to continue my journey of living my career.
